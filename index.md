Machine Learning Training Facility at Vanderbilt
================================================
The Machine Learning Training Facility (MLTF) at Vanderbilt enables
_scalable_ and _reproducible_ training for machine learning algorithms
at ACCRE, Vanderbilt's research computing center. Larger models and training
datasets are supported using both model- and data-parallel training techniques.
